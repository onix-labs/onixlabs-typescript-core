# TypeScript Core

The TypeScript Core library provides powerful, general-purpose APIs to TypeScript developers. TypeScript has become increasingly popular with JavaScript, web and NodeJS application developers. The objective of this framework is to provide a comprehensive type system and API surface making it easier to build and test applications with TypeScript.

## Setup

### Install

The framework uses NPM to set up development dependencies, such as TypeScript and TSLint. Before running any NPM tasks, the dependencies will need to be installed.

```
$ npm i
```

### Build

The following command will build the TypeScript `main` and `test` sources.
```
$ npm run build
```

### Test

The following command will execute the unit tests, which are driven from the framework's own unit testing framework.

```
$ npm run test
```
